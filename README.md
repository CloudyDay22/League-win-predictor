# League-win-predictor (WIP)

This is a super rough draft of a predictor of whether or not I'll win my next match in league of legends. So far, I can input the player levels in my current match 
and the model will predict (based on a CSV file of previous win/loses and player level data) if I'm going to win or lose this match.

I hope to connect this with Riot API to access data easier and more efficiently along with a wider range of predicting variables, such as opponent levels, ranks, etc.
